Detects input and output parameters that have a type of pointer to referential type.

**Before:**
```go
func f(m *map[string]int) (ch *chan *int)
```

**After:**
```go
func f(m map[string]int) (ch chan *int)
```

> Slices are not as referential as maps or channels, but it's usually
> better to return them by value rather than modyfing them by pointer.
