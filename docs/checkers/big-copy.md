Detects loops that copy big objects during each iteration.
Suggests to use index access or take address and make use pointer instead.

**Before:**
```go
xs := make([][1024]byte, length)
for _, x := range xs {
	// Loop body.
}
```

**After:**
```go
xs := make([][1024]byte, length)
for i := range xs {
	x := &xs[i]
	// Loop body.
}
```
