Detects expensive copies of `for` loop range expressions.

Suggests to use pointer to array to avoid the copy using `&` on range expression.

**Before:**
```go
var xs [256]byte
for _, x := range xs {
	// Loop body.
}
```

**After:**
```go
var xs [256]byte
for _, x := range &xs {
	// Loop body.
}
```
